This vegetation layer is the upper limit of the microtherrmal Fagus forest and it may be constituted by Picea in the lower part and by Larix in the higher part. In this area, human activity changed the original vegetation to pastures and grasslands by cutting the forests, while in other sites the alpine pastures are typically above the upper tree vegeta-tion line.
